Code Book

The following codebook describes the tidydata.txt dataset which is a processed subset of the data available at
'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip'

The original dataset contains train and test sets for observations from 30 subjects performing 6 different activities.
There are a total of 561 variables on which the data has been recorded.

The activities are as follows :
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

tidydata.txt contains the mean of observations from 30 subjects while performing 6 different activites.
There are a total of 81 variables on which these observations are recorded.

The columns of the dataset are for the following variables for only mean and standard deviation:
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Each row in the dataset represents the observation for one subject performing one activity,
The observations are mean values of the original observations.
